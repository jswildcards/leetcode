## Question Description
Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

### Examples
```java
"abcabcbb"  -> 3 ("abc"|"bca"|"cab")
"bbbbb"     -> 1 ("b")
"pwwkew"    -> 3 ("wke"|"kew")
"bbtablud"  -> 6 ("tablud")
```

### Constraints
- 0 <= `s.length` <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## How to Solve

First, before jump into the optimized solution, can you find out a method to solve this problem (like in O(n<sup>3</sup> time))?

### Initial Idea

To find the required substring, we need to look into each character of the string `s`. When we encounter a character that is seen before the current index, we discard that seen character and all the character before the seen character. For example,

```java
String s = "abcbda";
```

Let's say we have a variable `t` storing the longest substring required by the question and we have already processed the first 3 characters. i.e. `t = "abc"`.

When we encounter the second `'b'` (`s[3]`), if we want to continue to concat a substring that is fulfill the requirement, we need to discard the first `'b'` (`s[1]`), and all the character before the first `'b'`. At the end, `t = "cb"`.

The question is, do we need to use the similar approach to cut our substring when we encounter the second `'a'` (`s[5]`)? The answer is obviously no, as at that moment `t = "cbd"`, no `'a'`s are in the substring.

So, how can we determine when should we discard our string and use this information in our program efficiently (More specifically, `O(n)` Time Complexity and `O(1)` Space Complexity)? Well, we can use techniques called "Two Pointers" and "Memoization".

### Two Pointers

Let's continue to use the above example `s = "abcbda"`. Define 2 variables, `i` indicating the start index and `j` indicating the end index + 1 of the required substring, i.e. the required substring will be `s[i, j)`. Initialize both variables to `0`. We also define a variable called `result` to store the currently largest substring length;

```java
String s = "abcbda";
int i = 0;        // start index (inclusive)
int j = 0;        // end index (exclusive)
int result = 0;   // currently largest substring length
```

**Step 1**

```java
    a   b   c   b   d   a
    ^
   i,j
```

`i` and `j` are both pointed to `s[0]`. We will increase `j` by 1 and nothing else as the substring contains nothing.

**Step 2**

```java
    a   b   c   b   d   a
    ^   ^
    i   j
```

`j` is pointing to `s[1]`. We will increase `j` by 1 again and nothing else as the substring(`'a'`) does not appear repeated character.

**Step 3**

```java
    a   b   c   b   d   a
    ^       ^
    i       j
```

Again, the similar situation appeared in Step 2. (substring = `"ab"`)

**Step 4**

```java
    a   b   c   b   d   a
    ^           ^
    i           j
```

`j` is now pointing to `s[3]`, which is a `'b'`. We can discover that there is a `'b'` already in our substring. (Suppose we have a method to discover the appearance. We will talk about how to discover later.) That means the longest substring will only be `"abc"` for first 3 character. We now need to re-indicate `i` variable to our new substring starting index, which is `2` as `s[2] = 'c'` and between `s[2]` and `s[3]` no repeating characters appear.

If we want to know the length of this substring, we can do it by `j - i = 3 - 0 = 3`. We store this length in the `result` variable.

```java
result = j - i; // 3
```
```java
    a   b   c   b   d   a
            ^   ^
            i   j
```

After re-indicating the `i` variable, we get this diagram above.

**Step 5 - 7**

No characters repeated between `s[i]` and `s[j]` in the following steps and finally we will get the following result (by just increasing `j` by 1 in each step): 

```java
    a   b   c   b   d   a
            ^               ^
            i               j
```

The substring will be `s[i, j)` which is `"cbda"` and the length of this substring is `j - i = 6 - 2 = 4` which is larger than the previous `result`. We update our result to `4`.

```java
result = j - i; // 4
```

### Memoization

In this section, we are looking for a method that can store the index of `s[j]` and retrieve whether a character have been seen before `s[j]` efficiently.

From the problem statement we know that `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces. So, we can simply create an array containing the basic ASCII code (0 - 127).

When we encounter a character, we first check if the character has a index record before and the index is equals to or greater than `i` (the start index of our substring). If it is, we first get the current length of substring by `result = j - i`. Then, re-indicate `i` variable to our new substring starting index. Finally, whatever we can find the character before, we store the current index `j` to that character. We continue with the above example.

It is *different* from the memoization in dynamic programming, but it is still an optimized way to find whether a character is appeared before index `j` without exploring the string characters one by one.

We initialize an integer array with 128 spaces. Initially, all values contained in the array are `null`. For simplicity and easy understanding, the following document will use *Character* instead of *Integer* as the array index.

```java
Integer[] map = new Integer[128];
```

**Step 1**

```java
result = 0;
map['a'] = null; // Initially

    a   b   c   b   d   a
    ^
   i,j
```

The first character has been encountered is `'a'`. We do not have any record for `'a'` before. So, we simply mark `map['a'] = j` (where `j` is 0) indicates we have seen `'a'` at index `j`.

**Step 2**

```java
result = 0;
map['a'] = 0;
map['b'] = null; //Initially

    a   b   c   b   d   a
    ^   ^
    i   j
```

At here the character has been encountered is `'b'`. We do not have any record for `'b'` before. So, we simply mark `map['b'] = j` indicates we have seen `'b'` at index `j`.

**Step 3**

```java
result = 0;
map['a'] = 0;
map['b'] = 1;
map['c'] = null; //Initially

    a   b   c   b   d   a
    ^       ^
    i       j
```

At here the character has been encountered is `'c'`. We do not have any record for `'c'` before. So, we simply mark `map['c'] = j` indicates we have seen `'c'` at index `j`.

**Step 4**

```java
result = 0;
map['a'] = 0;
map['b'] = 1;
map['c'] = 2;

    a   b   c   b   d   a
    ^           ^
    i           j
```

At here the character has been encountered is `'b'`. If we check for `map['b']`, we can see that we have a record of `'b'`, which is `1`. We first calculate the length of the current substring `j - i` and compare with the original `result` variable. Then we re-indicate `i` variable to `map['b'] + 1` as the new start index of our substring. Finally we mark `map['b'] = j` indicates we have seen `'b'` at index `j`.

```java
result = Math.max(result, j - i); // Math.max(0, 3 - 0) = 3
map['a'] = 0;
map['b'] = 3;
map['c'] = 2;

    a   b   c   b   d   a
            ^   ^
            i   j
```

**Step 5**

```java
result = 3;
map['a'] = 0;
map['b'] = 3;
map['c'] = 2;
map['d'] = null;

    a   b   c   b   d   a
            ^       ^
            i       j
```

Nothing special, mark `map['d'] = j`.

**Step 6**

```java
result = 3;
map['a'] = 0;
map['b'] = 3;
map['c'] = 2;
map['d'] = 4;

    a   b   c   b   d   a
            ^           ^
            i           j
```

At here, we encounter a character `'a'`. If we look up for the memoization array `map['a']`, we *do* have encountered `'a'` before. But the value of `map['a']` is `0`, which is not a part of substring `s[i, j)`. 

We conclude that when the value of memoization array is smaller than the substring starting index (technically, `map[c] < i`, where `c` is the character we encounter, `'a'` in this case), we can ignore the index we marked before.

So, we just simply mark `map['a'] = j` indicates we have seen `'a'` at index `j` in this step.

**Step 7: Finishing Step**

```java
result = 3;
map['a'] = 0;
map['b'] = 3;
map['c'] = 2;
map['d'] = 4;

    a   b   c   b   d   a
            ^               ^
            i               j
```

We have finished exploring the whole string, just calculate the length of current substring `j - i`, compare it with `result`, and return the larger value, `4` in this case.

## Code

The code is the same as [here](https://github.com/jswildcards/leetcode/blob/main/src/Q0003.java).

You can use any containers provided by java Collections (HashMap is the most suitable one to solve general case in my opinion) other than array to store the indices. I just try to avoid using them when I can use array to solve the problem.

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int r = 0, i = 0, j = 0;
        Integer[] m = new Integer[128];

        for (; j < s.length(); j++) {
            int c = s.charAt(j);

            if (m[c] != null && i <= m[c]) {
                r = Math.max(r, j - i);
                i = m[c] + 1;
            }

            m[c] = j;
        }

        return Math.max(r, j - i);
    }
}
```
